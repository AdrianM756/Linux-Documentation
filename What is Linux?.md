## Linux

[Linux](https://www.linux.com/what-is-linux/) is an operating system, similar to [Windows](https://www.microsoft.com/en-ph/windows?r=1), [macOS](https://www.apple.com/by/macos/what-is/), and [iOS](https://www.techtarget.com/searchmobilecomputing/definition/iOS). It's the foundation behind Android, one of the worldâ€™s most widely used platforms. Operating systems manage computer hardware and enable software to function by handling the interaction between the two. Without an OS, software can't run.
